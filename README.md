## BARISTA SIMULATOR 2024

# About the game
This game was created over 48 hours (Jan 26 - Jan 28 2024, 5pm - 5pm) for RIT's Global Game jam.
This was all of our first times in a game jam, and half of us had never touched Godot before. We spent as much time learning how to create a game as we did actually creating it.
I'll be honest: this isn't a _good_ game. But it's a game - one of our first games - and it was done under a serious time crunch. I, at least, am proud of how it turned out.
